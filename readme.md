# Deadline-Constrained and Reliability-Aware Cost-Minimization Scheduling of Cloud Workflows

## abstract

Electricity prices exhibit regional disparities and temporal fluctuations. Executing cloud workflows in geographically distributed data centers incurs substantial electricity costs due to cross-domain data transmission and compute-intensive operations. To reduce energy consumption and electricity expenditures, cloud service providers commonly adopt Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques by lowering processor frequencies. However, inappropriate frequency scaling can significantly increase the risk of transient faults during task execution, thereby compromising the reliability of workflow execution. Consequently, a critical research challenge lies in designing a cost-efficient workflow scheduling strategy that ensures workflow deadlines are met while maintaining execution reliability.
