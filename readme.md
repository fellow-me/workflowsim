# A cloud workflow simulation scheduling framework developed based on CloudSim

## feature

* Supports workflow scheduling across geo-distributed data centers
* Supports Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), with consideration for transient faults induced by DVFS technology
* Features a task retry mechanism that automatically re-executes jobs upon transient fault occurrences
