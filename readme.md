# A cloud workflow simulation scheduling framework developed based on CloudSim

## feature

* Supports multi-workflow scheduling across geo-distributed data centers
* Supports Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), with consideration for transient faults induced by DVFS technology
* Features a job retry mechanism that automatically re-executes jobs upon transient fault occurrences
* Supports the generation of various types of workflow instances, such as Montage, CyberShake, and more. Additionally, 
the number of jobs in a workflow can be customized
* Supports workflow parsing and displays the job dependency graph
* Supports visualization of simulation results, showing the entire simulation process as a Gantt chart
* Supports multiple levels of logging
* Supports printing of simulation and experimental results to the console
